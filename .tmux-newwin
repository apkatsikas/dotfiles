# The idea being to open new windows into the set `$PWD` with this script,
# while another binding per-version inside `.tmux.conf` will handle opening
# new windows into the same directory as the current pane
#
# It uses a `$PWD` settings in the tmux session environment for this so that
# the value can be altered on-the-fly
