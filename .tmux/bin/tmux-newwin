This script exists to be called from within tmux (most likely from a
keybinding)
Assuming PWD is set in the tmux *session*, it will open a new window
into that dir. It handles this differently for version pre- and post-1.9
due to breaking changes on the new-window command starting with 1.9.

The idea being to open new windows into the set \`\$PWD\` with this script,
while another binding per-version inside \`.tmux.conf\` will handle opening
new windows into the same directory as the current pane

It uses a \`\$PWD\` setting in the tmux session environment for this so that
the value can be altered on-the-fly

Usage:
  $(basename "${0}") <tmux version>

if [ "${1}" == '-h' ] || [ "${1}" == '--help' ]; then
  echo "${helptext}"
  exit 0
elif [ -z "${TMUX}" ] || [ -z "${1}" ]; then
  echo "${helptext}"
  exit 1
fi

tmux_vers="${1}"

sessionname=$(tmux display-message -p '#S')
pwd=$(tmux show-environment | grep -E -m 1 '^PWD=' | sed 's/^PWD=//')

if [ "$(echo "$tmux_vers < 1.7" | bc)" = 1 ]; then
  tmux set-option default-path "${pwd}"
  tmux new-window
elif [ "$(echo "$tmux_vers < 1.9" | bc)" = 1 ]; then
  tmux set-option -q default-path "${pwd}"
  tmux new-window
else
  tmux new-window -c "${pwd}"
